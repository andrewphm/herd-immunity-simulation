# Herd Immunity Simulation

### How to run:

This program requires some command line arguments to run.

Let's look at an example:

Population Size: 100,000

Vaccination Percentage: 90%

Virus Name: Ebola

Mortality Rate: 70%

Reproduction Rate: 25%

People Initially Infected: 10

Then I would type in the terminal:

```js
python3 simulation.py 100000 0.90 Ebola 0.70 0.25 10

```
